243250,"Hellblazer, Volume 5: Dangerous Habits",0,That's not to say that Ennis didn't get flowery every now and then; but his style has more control and less showmanship which was refreshing since it allowed readers to focus on the story more than the linguistic style it was employed with.

60979,"The Wheel of Osheim (The Red Queen's War, #3)",0,"And that's my main issue with this book and this trilogy - it's perfectly enjoyable, but it treads a lot of the same ground as the earlier series and feels like everything's played for lower stakes, and though the main character is unusual for fantasy, he's just not quite as compelling as his predecessor."
