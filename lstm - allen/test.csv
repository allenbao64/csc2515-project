256524,By Your Side,0,And on the other he'd be very much non-approved dating guy if he didn't (at least to the extent that it'd be something Autumn would face explicitly in both personal evaluation and with regards to parents and concerned friends).

114548,Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay,0,"I also appreciated the tie ins to the original HP stories, like with newt carrying a Hufflepuff scarf, mentions of Dumbledore, nifflers, and the deathly hallows."
279216,"An Ancient Peace (Peacekeeper, #1; Confederation, #6)",1,"I should also note that I had a lot of trouble following the geography of the last couple chambers -- i.e., how the bunker related to the ship, how the original chamber with the pool of water related to the ship, where exactly the 'zombie' H'San were when Torin first went in, etc."
